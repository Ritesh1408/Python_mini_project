Title: Image Resizer using OpenCV

Description:
This project utilizes OpenCV, a popular computer vision library, to resize images efficiently. The script takes an input image, resizes it based on a specified scale percentage, and saves the resized image to a specified destination.

Installation:
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can install OpenCV using pip:
```
pip install opencv-python
```

Usage:
1. Clone the repository or download the script `image_resizer.py`.
2. Place the image you want to resize in the same directory as the script.
3. Open the terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory containing the script and the image.
5. Run the script using the following command:
   ```
   python image_resizer.py
   ```
6. Follow the prompts to enter the source image file name, destination file name, and scale percentage.
7. Once the script completes execution, the resized image will be saved in the specified destination.

Example:
Suppose you have an image named `example.jpg` in the same directory as the script. To resize it to 50% and save the resized image as `resized_example.png`, follow these steps:
1. Run the script.
2. Enter `example.jpg` as the source file name.
3. Enter `resized_example.png` as the destination file name.
4. Enter `50` as the scale percentage.
5. The resized image `resized_example.png` will be saved in the same directory.
